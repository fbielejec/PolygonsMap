We want to have an easy an efficient way of drawing our own maps from comma 
separated coordinate values. This would allow us to use different map projections,
zoom in to areas of interest, save output to post script (eps) images and many 
others.

To operate :left click to rotate, right click to zoom, both or middle to pan.

                            COMPILING

Depends on the following Processing libraries:

core.jar
PeasyCam.jar

                              TODO

* Polygons don't get filled (!!!)
* Reassign interfaces:
 - left mouse drag to pane
 - middle drag to rotate the camera 
* Camera is not re-set when changing projections
